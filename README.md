## Assingment
This is an assingment for Code Fellows Ruby on Rails dev accelerator program that consisted of: Create your own app that uses a has_many :through association. This means it uses a join model, that tracks information about how two sides of a many-to-many relation are connected. The join model itself will likely be named with a word ending in *ment or *ship: an Appointment resource would track VIPs and the boards they are appointed to (and perhaps their start/end date on the board). A Membership resource would track which Users belong to which Groups (and perhaps their role in the group). My approach to this was to create three rescources, subscriber, magazine, and a subscriptions join table. A big thank you to Matt Sayer for his great blog post http://www.gitmatt.com/posts/5.
